We cherished and enjoyed her various stages of growth at Ranipet, Pondy and later at Chennai. Brilliant at her studies hence excelled in her academics. Unique character with calmness. Her marriage brought another man of exceptional personality with a combination of brilliancy and character into our circle and particularly a good company for me.
